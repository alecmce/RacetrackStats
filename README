TODO:

The structure of the graphs is wrong. They should take a rolling mean or other data
provider as an input at the start, and then some form of notification relationship
should be established. (AS3Signals, I suppose)

In order to counter the problem that the 'render' portion takes up both the time it
takes to render the screen and the remaining 'empty slices', the autoCrank feature
will up the frame-rate until there are no more 'empty slices', then stabilizes. This
should allow us to see not only.
